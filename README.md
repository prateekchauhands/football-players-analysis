# Football Players Analysis | Big 5 European Leagues 

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the stats, performances, and comparisons of various football players from the top 5 leagues across Europe from season 2019-20 to 2021-22. The data is sourced from fbref website and has been processed using Power BI to create a database for easy management, analysis, and exploration of the data visually and to gain valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data of various stats of football players from the top 5 leagues across Europe from season 2019-20 till 2021-22. The data has been sourced from the website of [fbref](https://fbref.com/en/), which ensures its authenticity and reliability.

I have only considered the top division from the biggest 5 European football (soccer) leagues: England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France.

The dataset includes information such as season, league name, player name, team name, goals, assists, xG, xA, shots on target, shots, fouls committed, yellow cards, red cards etc.

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the source website requires some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Power Query Editor within Power BI has been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Technologies Used
Power Query Editor: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation into the database.

Microsoft Power BI: For data analysis and visualization.
